\chapter{Sampling}
This block takes the output of the generation block and takes samples of it to be send to the reconstruction block. 
This section is the simulation of hardware with less samplerate than the input signal.


\section{Multicoset Sampling}
\subsection{concept}
In multicoset sampling, the input signal is measured by M different devices that all have a sampling frequency that is substantially lower than the sampling frequency of the input signal. Each device samples the signal at a lower frequency, and then integrate and dumps the signal every N samples.
