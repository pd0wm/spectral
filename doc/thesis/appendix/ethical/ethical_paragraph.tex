\section{Ethical paragraph}
This chapter is concerned with the ethical aspect of our business plan. The development of our prudct, a toolkit that enables high performance wideband spectrum sensing, has several possible consequences. This ethical paragraph will discuss those possible consequences by analyzing the internal and external policy seperately.

\subsection{Intern policy}

For early development of our product we make use of a loose management structure. The gravity of different opinions is a direct reflection of the expertise of the employees on the subject. We let the employees with the most expertise on a subject use their proffesional responsibility to make important design choices. In hiring new employees we will try to limit the influence of etnical factors like race or gender to a bare minimum. Important qualities are productivity, expertise, and responsibility. We expect that when the company grows, we need to introduce more elements of management into our structure to allow for a coordinated workflow.


\subsection{Extern policy}

Our product is a software toolkit that enables high speed wideband spectrum sensing. We accompany this toolkit by guidelines and technology descriptions that allow hardware developers to integrate our technology into their systems. We take an utilitarian point of view at the responsibility of application of this product: as we can not exactly foresee all possible applications, nor do we have the capability to influence this, we will only take responsibility for our product itself. By adhering to the local legal requirements of telecommunications we epxect that misuse\footnote{One could think of applications where spectrum sensing is used to eavesdrop communication} of our toolkit is reduced to a bare minimum, while maintaining a commercially viable situation. Environment and safety are off less concern in our policy as our company is targeted at software and not on the actual hardware. This also holds for the production of our products: because software can be duplicated without effort we do not need to collaborate with companys in poor countrys.
