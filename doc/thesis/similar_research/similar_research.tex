\chapter{Similar research}

Although the concept of a Cognitive Radio network is still at a conceptual stage, compressive sampling has been researched in for example 
\cite{candes2007sparsity,candes2006robust,zhang2008theory,candes2008introduction}. Furthermore, recent developments have introduced techniques to perform compressive wideband sensing by noticing that in cognitive radio the signal content is not of interest, only its presence in the spectrum \cite{ariananda2012compressive,ariananda2014cooperative}. 

The sampling techniques to sample signals at sub-Nyquist frequencies can be found in \cite{pal2011coprime,ariananda2011multicoset,lexa2011multi} and provide us with information on how to sample signals that can serve as the input for compressive spectrum sensing algorithms.

Detection of signals in general is a mature field, and lots of information can be found in textbooks concering detection, for example \cite{couch2013digital,kay1998fundamentals}. Detection for use in Cognitive Radio, is still an active area of research. A recent overview of techniques for spectrum sensing as a whole for use in Cognitive Radio is given by \cite{axell2012spectrum}. Other detection methods for use in cognitive radio can be found in \cite{han2013novel,zheng2009spectrum}.

Although there is similar theoretical research available, we have only found a few details about practical implementations, which also motivates the distinction between the theoretical aspect and implementation in this thesis.
