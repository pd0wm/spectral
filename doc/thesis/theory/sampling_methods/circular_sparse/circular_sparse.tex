\section{Sampling and reconstruction}
In this previous section we discussed three multi-coset sampling methods. In \cref{sec:reconstruction-algorithm}, we saw that the sampling method determines the configuration, which is the way the samplers sample the input signal. The configuration then yields $c_i[n]$. Remember that the sampling signal $c_i[n]$ represents the way sampler $i$ samples the input signal. If these $c_i[n]$ satisfy the requirements stated in \cref{sec:reconstruction-implementation}, then the algorithm described in \cref{sec:reconstruction-algorithm} can be used to reconstruct the power spectral density of the sampled signal. We will reconsider these requirements one by one.

Every $c_i[n]=0$ for $n < 0$ and $n > N-1$. Since $c_i[n]=1$ if coset $i$ samples the $N-n$'th sample of every group of $N$ samples of the input signal, which was discussed in \cref{sec:reconstruction-algorithm}, this requirement is satisfied.

Furthermore, all $c_i[n]=1$ for a single $n=n_i$ and otherwise zero. Every coset $i$ samples a single sample of every group of $N$ samples of the input signal. Therefore, this requirement is also satisfied.

Finally, the following problem must be satisfied.

\begin{description}
    \item[Circular sparse ruler problem] The set consisting of $|n_i - n_j|$ and $N-|n_i-n_j|$ for all combinations of $i$ and $j$ make up $0,\ldots,N-1$.
\end{description}

Let $d=|n_i - n_j|$ or $d=N-|n_i-n_j|$. Equivalently, $d$ is the integer difference of the numbers of the samples taken by two samplers of every group of $N$ samples of the input signal. We now say that \textit{lag $d$ is estimated}. The circular sparse ruler problem can be reformulated as follows.

\begin{description}
    \item[Circular sparse ruler problem (alternative formulation)] Lags $0,\ldots,N-1$ must be estimated.
\end{description}

We have abstracted the satisfaction of the requirements necessary for reconstruction to the alternative formulation of the circular sparse ruler problem. The circular sparse ruler problem is treated in a more abstract way in \cref{ap:circ-ruler}. From now on, we assume that we have solutions to the circular sparse ruler problem readily available.

\subsection{Circular sparse ruler sampling}\label{sub:ci-circ}
Since the solutions to the circular sparse ruler problem are readily available, we can choose all $c_i[n]$ such that the problem is satisfied. Then all requirements stated in \cref{sec:reconstruction-implementation} are satisfied and the sampled signal can be reconstructed. It is important to note that $c_i[n]$ is defined for $i = 1,\ldots,M$, which was explained in \cref{sec:reconstruction-algorithm}. Therefore, the solution to the circular sparse ruler problem yields a value for $M$. The parameter $M$ determines the amount of samplers which are required. Since we want to minimise the amount of samplers, we should choose a solution to the circular sparse ruler problem such that $M$ is minimal. This is discussed in \cref{ap:circ-ruler}.
