\section{Introduction}
as described in ref \todo{ref}, The sampling techniques \emph{must} allow for
\begin{enumerate}
    \item correction operation of the detection;
    \item usage of a single sampling device and
    \item usage of multiple sampling devices such that the workload can be distributed across the devices.
\end{enumerate}

The sampling techniques \emph{should} allow for
\begin{enumerate}
    \item sampling as efficient as possible.
\end{enumerate}

Theory on different sampling methods has already been published. \textit{Circular sparse sampling} \cite{ariananda2012compressive}, \textit{collaborative sampling} \cite{ariananda2014cooperative} and \textit{coprime sampling} \cite{pal2011coprime} describe different sampling methods and how to implement them in their respective frameworks. Each of these techniques impose their own restrictions on the design of a sampling device. Circular sparse sampling enforces that the sampling is done by a single device with multiple samplers with the same sample frequency $N$. Collaborative sampling enforces multiple devices with multiple samplers with the same sample frequency $N$. Coprime sampling enforces the use of one device with exactly two samplers, but allows for different sampling frequencies. Each sampling method is designed to perform well in situations where their restrictions are in order.

In this chapter we will investigate \textit{circular sparse sampling} , \textit{collaborative sampling} and \textit{coprime sampling}, and fit them into our system in such a way that it can collaborate with the reconstruction algorithm, and therefore enable correct operation of the detection. For every sampling technique we will also look for ways to optimise their efficiency as stated. Specifically in circular sparse sampling will we look at ways to improve efficiency.
