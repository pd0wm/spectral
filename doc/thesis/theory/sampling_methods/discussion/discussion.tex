\section{Conclusion}
We have discussed three sampling techniques that can be used with our system. Each method imposes different constraints and offers different advantages such that the specifications in \cref{sec:theory-specs} are satisfied. That is, circular sparse sampling can be used for sampling with a single device, whereas collaborative and corpime sampling can be used for sampling with multiple devices.  All sampling techniques, however, allow for correct operation of the detection.
