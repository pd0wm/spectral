\section{Conclusion and discussion}
In this section we have designed and modified three sampling techniques to fit our system. Each method imposing different constraint and offering improvements in other ways. These requirements of the sampling techniques where \todo{copy paste + ref}. We were able to propose three techniques that met the requirements, where circular sparse sampling and coprime sampling used one device, and collaborative a way to utilize multiple devices.

In this context there is no such thing as a best sampling technique, because all sampling techniques optimalise performance for different situations. Therefore the context of the product will determine which sampling technique suits best.

For circular sparse ruler we constructed solutions with higher performance than proposed in \cite{ariananda2012compressive}. This is a novel result and contributes to higher efficiency in our product. We also made an recursive algorithm to generate circular sparse ruler solutions,  but this was a less clean approach, because it used  theorys we could not prove, and therefore did not guarantee to find the best solutions. 

\section{Future work}
We implemented three sampling methods that are very much different and fed them into the same system. This shows potential for a more general sampling system. For instance: what happens when we combine multiple coprime devices, or what happens when we pick the circular sparse ruler problem, and allow the sampling frequency to differ. There is potential to look fo a more general sampling strategy but investigating this further needs future work.

This also holds for optimisation strategies. It would be very interesting to compare the different optimisation strategies and see whether they can benefit from each other. The collaborative sampler has for example currently no good algorithm to find configurations for more than two devices with more than three samplers. 

In this section we saw the sampling strategies grow towards each other and it would be interesting to see what happens if they move even further towards each other in the future. 

For collaborative sampling we looked at a method where the different devices are used to sense more bandwidth, but collaborative sampling can also be used for other purposes, like increasing accuracy, or sensing in a larger radius. We did not look at these applications and should be considered future work.
