\section{Concept}
The reconstruction imposes two specifications for the sampling methods:
\begin{enumerate}
\item all lags in $\mathbb{Z}$ must be available
\item the sampling method must be described by sampling matrix $\mathbf{C}$
\end{enumerate}
We will propose three methods to handle these specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{circular sparse sampling}
\item \textit{collaborative sampling}
\item \textit{coprime sampling}
\end{itemize}
each of these techniques impose their own restrictions to the sampling. Circular sparse ruler enforces that the sampling is done by a single device with multiple samplers with the same sample frequency. Collaborative sampling is done with multiple device with multiple samplers with the same sample frequency. Coprime sampling enforces the use of one device with exactly two samplers, but allows for different sampling frequencies. Each of these approaches have their advantages for certain situations.

\subsection{Circular sparse sampling}
Circular sparse sampling uses samplers with equal sampling frequency $NT$. where $T$ is the sampling frequency of the signal to be reconstructed, and $N$ the down-sampling factor. This property ensures that the accumulated samples have a period of $N$. This is illustrated in \cref{tkz:circsparseruler}. In the example $N = 7$

The switches are samplers that sample and hold the signal $x[n]$ at a given time. The N$\,\downarrow$ is an integrate and dump with a factor $N$. $N$ samples are added together and dumped at the output. The signal $y_i[k]$ has therefore $N$ times less samples than $x[n]$. Now that we have the sampling down, we need to tell the reconstructor how the sampling was done to enpower the reconstructor to calculate the autocorrelation of the input signal $x[n]$. We do this by supplying a vector $\mathbf{c_i}$ for every coset that describes the configuration of the sampler of the coset in such a way that \todo{formule moet beter}
$$
\sum_{n=kN}^{(k+1)N-1}(\mathbf{x}\mathbf{c_i})[n] = y_i[k].
$$
For example the vectors $\mathbf{c_i}$ in \cref{tkz:circsparseruler} would  look like:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\color{orange} \mathbf{c_1}$ = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
\item $\color{green} \mathbf{c_2}$ = [0,1,0,0,0,0,0]
\item $\color{cyan} \mathbf{c_3}$ = [0,0,0,1,0,0,0]
\end{itemize}

The way these vectors are chosen has a big influence on performance, but this will we discussed in a later section.

\subsection{Collaborative sampling}

Collaborative sampling is fairly similar to circ
