\section{Discussion}

A comparison between the different sampling techniques to decide which one suits best is in our product not relevant. We try to make our Toolkit as much general purpose as possible, and therefore is it in our interest to enable as much sampling techniques as possible. Also there is no "one size fits all", because all techniques are designed to optimise different situations.

In the investigation of sampling techniques we have given each technique a similar approach. This enables us to not only see the differences between the different sampling techniques, but primarily their similarities. We saw that all three sampling methods are different solutions for the same problem, but have some different extra requirements. Note for example that the circular sparse sampling method, is also a collaborative sampling method for one device. From this observation rises the question if it would be possible to deduce a  general purpose configuration optimiser. This would be considered future work.  

This also holds for optimisation strategies. It would be very interesting to compare the different optimisation strategies and see whether they can benefit from each other. The collaborative sampler has for example currently no good algorithm to find configurations for a random amount of devices with a random amount of samplers. This is considered future work.

For collaborative sampling we looked at a method where the different devices are used to sense more bandwidth, but collaborative sampling can also be used for other purposes, like increasing accuracy, or sensing in a larger radius. We did not look at these applications and this should be considered future work.

For circular sparse ruler we constructed solutions with higher performance than proposed in \cite{ariananda2012compressive}. Our method for computing circular sparse ruler solutions is a novelty and contributes to higher efficiency in our product.
