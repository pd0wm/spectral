\section{Introduction}
The sampler has to sample the spectrum in a clever way. It needs make sure that every time-lag necessary to reconstruct the autocorrelation is available with the least amount of effort. To achieve this we make use of multi-coset sampling. Multi-coset sampling is a set of all sampling methods that make use of multiple samplers, also called cosets. We will see that there are different approaches available to obtain the necessary information using multiple cosets.
