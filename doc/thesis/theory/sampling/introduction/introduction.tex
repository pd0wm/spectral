\section{Introduction}
The first step of spectrum sensing is sampling the signal. Conventional methods sample at the Nyquist rate to ensure complete reconstruction of the signal. However, when we only need to reconstruct the autocorrelation of a wide sense stationary signal, we can do better. \todo{background appendix} The autocorrelation is the cross-correlation with itself at different points in time. The cross-correlation is the inner-product of two signals at different time-lags. Because the signal is wide sense stationary, the autocorrelation does not change over time. Not only that, the different components of the autocorrelation only vary with relative time-lags and not through time. Therefore the different components can be calculated separately. This property is exploited to achieve better results than sampling at the Nyquist rate. The task of the sampler is now no longer to sample at a high enough frequency, but to make sure that every time-lag necessary to reconstruct the autocorrelation is available. To achieve this we make use of multi-coset sampling. Multi-coset sampling is a set of all sampling methods that make use of multiple samplers, or cosets. We will see that there are different approaches available to obtain the necessary information using multiple cosets.
