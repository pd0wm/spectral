\section{Introduction}

\cref{cha:sampling}, \cref{cha:reconstruction}, \cref{cha:sampling_methods}, \cref{cha:detection} have analysed and described several
sampling, reconstruction and detection techniques. It is in this chapter that we will evaluate their performance such that a discussion and a conclusion can be draw based on the specifications as listed in ???.

\section{Overview}
A block diagram of the complete system is depicted in ???

\section{Testing}

To evaluate the performance of our system we will 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item evaluate the performance of the reconstruction and feeding it an artificial constructed signal \textbf{wat zullen we hiermee doen? allemaal bandjes maken en dezelfde ook de detector in mikken?} while

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item varying the sampling technique used to sample the signal (as described in \cref{cha:sampling_methods}).
		\item varying the compression rate and the oversampling factor (as described in \cref{cha:reconstruction}).
	\end{enumerate}

	By comparing the reconstructed the power spectral density to the power spectral density recovered directly from the constructed test signal, we can evaluate the correctness of reconstruction when used with a specific sampling technique.
	Furthermore the dependence on the oversampling factor and
	the compression factor can be evaluated from those test results. 
	
	\item Adress the performance of detection on the reconstructed signal. The energy detector as described in \cref{ssec:ari_ed} will be evaluated by testing on an artificial input signal. 

	This is signal is constructed by generating complex white noise which is filtered using (\textbf{several???}) bandpass filter. To this filtered signal we add additive white noise. This signal is then artificially sampled and fed to the reconstructor. 
	\textbf{plaatje welkom denk ik?}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item varying the signal-to-noise ratio of the input signal; 
		\item varying the false alarm probability the detector 
		should allow;
		\item varying the compression rate of the reconstructor.
	\end{enumerate}
	Using these results we can construct the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC-curves) which plot the detection probability versus the false alarm probability of the detector. 
	From these curves the minimum signal strength and the detectors performance on a random signal can be evaluated. Furthermore the detection performance of the system as a whole can be evaluated by comparing these curves for different compression rates.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
het werkt. Future work -> collaborative detection/prior information/neural netwerk ding?

\section{Discussion: keesch}
For circular sparse ruler we constructed solutions with higher performance than proposed in \cite{ariananda2012compressive}. Our method is a novelty and contributes to higher efficiency in our product. We also made an recursive algorithm to generate circular sparse ruler solutions,  but this was a less clean approach, because it used  theorys we could not prove, and therefore did not guarantee to find the best solutions. Overall we managed to get a lot of efficiency out of the sampling techniques, but we cannot know for sure whether a more efficient solution is possible or not.

We implemented three sampling methods that are quite different and fit them into our system. This shows potential for a more general sampling technique. For instance: what happens when we combine multiple coprime devices, or what happens when we pick the circular sparse ruler problem, and allow the sampling frequency to differ. There is potential to look fo a more general sampling strategy but investigating this further needs future work.

This also holds for optimisation strategies. It would be very interesting to compare the different optimisation strategies and see whether they can benefit from each other. The collaborative sampler has for example currently no good algorithm to find configurations for more than two devices with more than three samplers. 

In this section we saw the sampling strategies grow towards each other and it would be interesting to see what happens if they move even further towards each other in the future. 

For collaborative sampling we looked at a method where the different devices are used to sense more bandwidth, but collaborative sampling can also be used for other purposes, like increasing accuracy, or sensing in a larger radius. We did not look at these applications and this should be considered future work.
