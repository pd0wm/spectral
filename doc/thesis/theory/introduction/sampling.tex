\subsection{Sampling}
The first step of spectrum sensing is sampling the signal. Conventional methods sample at the so called Nyquist rate \todo{background appendix} to ensure complete reconstruction of the signal for a given bandwidth. The Nyquist rate increases as the bandwidth increases. This poses a problem for very large bandwidths. The Nyquist rate becomes so high that no hardware implementation is realistic. To increase the bandwidth limit we need other ways than increasing the sampling rate to increase the bandwidth. To achieve this we use multiple samplers instead of higher sampling rates. We will see that this approach allows us to increase bandwidth substantially using state-of-the-art sampling and reconstruction techniques with multiple samplers.
