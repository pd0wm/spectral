\subsection{Detection}
The detection process operates on the autocorrelation as provided by the \emph{reconstructor}. By calculating the power spectral density from the autocorrelation we obtain the expected average power per frequency. This information can be used by the detector to itself is not concerned about the information encoded in those signals, but only in which frequency bands they occupy.
