\section{Introduction}
% Compressive sensing is a subject that has made some important improvements in recent years. D.Ariananda and G.Leus published a paper in 2012 that proposed a new method in compressive sampling. When calculating the power spectral density of a signal, a lot of information is lost during the process. This paper exploits this fact by sampling in such a way, that only the information required to calculate the power spectral density is acquired. This allows for much less samples than Nyquist.

Compressive sensing is an active area of research \textbf{meer}. Most algorithms are based on L1-techniques and try to recover the spectrum of the signal, and therefore assume that the signal is \emph{sparse} in the Fourier domain. Recent developments \textbf{papers van leus en ariananda hier} have shown that it is possible to reconstruct the power spectral density instead of the spectrum without the assumption of sparsity.

This thesis targets a accessible theoretical description of the compressive sensing system implemented during
