\section{Introduction}
In this part, we develop an approach to enable high-performance spectrum sensing. More specifically, we develop techniques which are implemented in various modules of the toolkit.

\section{System overview}
- modules: \\
* Sampling techniques which allow for efficient spectrum sensing \\
* Reconstruction module which analyses the sampled signal in real-time \\
* Detection module which performs identification of the spectrum based on the output of the reconstruction algorithm \\

\section{Requirements and specifications}
The requirements of our approach are as follows. The approach must enable spectrum sensing such that the application
\begin{enumerate}
    \item is able to identify at which frequencies signals are present, where signals
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item can be any signal distinct from noise and
        \item can have any reasonable signal strength;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item is able to sense any specified bandwidth and
    \item makes use of sampling techniques which are more efficient than conventional sampling techniques.
\end{enumerate}

The specifications of our approach are as follows. Identification of signals must be such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item idenfication of signals consists of determines the set of frequencies with are occupied by signals other than noise;
    \item this identification can be done real-time;
    \item the resolution of these frequencies can be specified and
    \item the correctness of operation can be specified.
\end{enumerate}
Identification of signals should be such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the resolution of detection can be as high as possible and
    \item its operation can be as accurate as possible.
\end{enumerate}

The sampling techniques must be such that they allow for
\begin{enumerate}
    \item usage of a single sampling device and
    \item usage of multiple devices such that the workload can be distributed across the sampling devices.
\end{enumerate}

We will design our system according to these requirements and specifications.

% Compressive sensing is a subject that has made some important improvements in recent years. D.Ariananda and G.Leus published a paper in 2012 that proposed a new method in compressive sampling. When calculating the power spectral density of a signal, a lot of information is lost during the process. This paper exploits this fact by sampling in such a way, that only the information required to calculate the power spectral density is acquired. This allows for much less samples than Nyquist.

% Compressive sensing is an active area of research \textbf{meer}. Most algorithms are based on L1-techniques and try to recover the spectrum of the signal, and therefore assume that the signal is \emph{sparse} in the Fourier domain. Recent developments \textbf{papers van leus en ariananda hier} have shown that it is possible to reconstruct the power spectral density instead of the spectrum without the assumption of sparsity.
