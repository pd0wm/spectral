\chapter{Introduction}
\textit{Noise is omnipresent. Even in the presence of signals, noise always will always be there. Distincting between noise and signals forms an alluring problem; can good be distincted from evil? One often asks where signals prevail in the ocean of noise. But this ocean is wide, as wide as the spectrum of every observed signal. And we do not have the power to sail this ocean. Therefore, we must be smart.}

% \section{Introduction}
In the context of the spectrum of a signal, it is often asked which frequencies are occupied, and which are not. To solve this problem, one has to sense the spectrum. Spectrum sensing is determining which frequencies of a signal are occupied, and which are not. An occupied frequency means that it contains a signal distinct from noise. Therefore, the following problem arises. Given a signal, can we determine which frequencies of that signal are occupied with signals distinct from noise? In the introduction, we have seen that this question is asked in many applications.

This question however, is an answered question. By means of sampling and analysing the spectrum, one provides an answer. But this only works for frequencies relatively close together. It turns out that for frequencies far apart, spectrum sensing requires expensive hardware. And so a new question arises. Can we efficiently spectrum sense in the case of frequencies far apart? Wideband spectrum sensing tries to answers this very question. One then tries to determine which frequencies are occupied in a wide band.

Easy, it turns out to be not. Consequently, wideband spectrum sensing is an active area of research, and there is no definitive answer yet.

In this part, we develop an approach to enable high-performance real-time wideband spectrum sensing. The part is divided into several chapters. We start with a detailed description of our approach, which we consider to be a system. Then, we give an overview of this system. In the overview, we look at the different system components, which will be described in separate chapters afterwards. Finally, we will evaluate the system as a whole.
