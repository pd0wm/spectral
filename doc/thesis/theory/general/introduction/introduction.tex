Compressive sensing is a subject that has made some important improvements in recent years. D.Ariananda and G.Leus published a paper in 2012 that proposed a new method in compressive sampling. When calculating the power spectral density of a signal, a lot of information is lost during the process. This paper exploits this fact by sampling in such a way, that only the information required to calculate the power spectral density is acquired. This allows for much less samples than Nyquist.
