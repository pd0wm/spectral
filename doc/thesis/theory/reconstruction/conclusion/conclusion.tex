\section{Conclusion}
We have discussed an algorithm to reconstruct in real-time the power spectral density, or equivalently the autocorrelation, of a signal sampled at sub-Nyquist frequencies. We notice that $\mat{R}$ and thus $\mat{R}^\dagger$ can be precomputed, and all matrix manipulations experience a significant speedup because $\mat{R}$ is usually sparse. Therefore, our algorithm allows for fast real-time estimation of the power spectral density of the sampled signal. This is in constrast to other methods available, since these methods are mostly based on optimisation or complex algorithms, which yields computationally expensive methods.
