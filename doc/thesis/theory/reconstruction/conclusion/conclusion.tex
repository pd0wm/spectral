\section{Conclusion}
We have discussed an algorithm to reconstruct in real-time the power spectral density, or equivalently the autocorrelation, of a signal sampled at sub-Nyquist frequencies. Notice that $\mat{R}$ and thus $\mat{R}^\dagger$ can be precomputed, and all matrix manipulations experience a significant speedup because $\mat{R}$ is sparse. Therefore, our algorithm allows for fast real-time estimation of the power spectral density of the sampled signal. This is in constrast to other methods available, since these methods are mostly based on $l_1$-optimisation, which yields complex and computationally expensive methods.
