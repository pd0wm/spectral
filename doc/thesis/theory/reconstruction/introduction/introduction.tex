\section{Introduction}
This chapter introduces a method to reconstruct the power spectral density of a signal which is sampled at sub-Nyquist frequencies. Usually, sampling at sub-Nyquist frequencies causes aliasing, which means that the signal is distorted. Our reconstruction method is able to reconstruct the power spectral density of the signal, despite the fact that is sampled signal is aliased. We focus on an accessible, yet complete explanation of the reconstruction method which discusses all details necessary for implementation.

First of all, we will consider various methods which allow for reconstruction of the power spectral density of signal sampled at sub-Nyquist frequencies. We will then choose one of these methods, based on careful considerations. Next, we will discuss an algorithm based on this method. Afterwards, we will discuss a detailed derivation of the algorithm. This derivation will be accessible and easy to follow for people without highly technical background. After the derivation, we will discuss some details which turn out to be essential when implementing the algorithm.

\section{Overview}
There are various methods to reconstruct the power spectral density of a signal. These methods can be roughly divided in two groups. First, there are methodes based on $l_1$-optimisation, such as \cite{bayarkernel, candes2006robust, candes2007sparsity, candes2008introduction, kirolos2006analog, li2014gomp, polo2009compressive}, which can make use of computationally intensive methods, such as the MUSIC algorithm \cite{pal2011coprime}. Second, there are methods which do not make use of such optimisation, such as \cite{ariananda2011multicoset,ariananda2012compressive}.
