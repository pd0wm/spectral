\section{Introduction}
This chapter introduces a method to reconstruct the power spectral density of a signal which is sampled at sub-Nyquist frequencies. Usually, sampling at sub-Nyquist frequencies causes aliasing, which means that the signal is distorted. Our reconstruction method is able to reconstruct the power spectral density of the signal, despite the fact that is sampled signal is aliased. We focus on an accessible, yet complete explanation of the reconstruction method which discusses all details necessary for implementation.

First of all, we will consider various methods which allow for reconstruction of the power spectral density of signals sampled at sub-Nyquist frequencies. We will then choose one of these methods, based on careful considerations. Next, we will discuss an algorithm based on this method. Afterwards, we will discuss a detailed derivation of the algorithm. This derivation will be accessible and easy to follow for people without highly technical background. After the derivation, we will discuss some details which turn out to be essential when implementing the algorithm.

\section{Overview}
There are various methods to reconstruct the power spectral density of a signal. These methods can be roughly divided in two groups: methodes based on $l_1$-optimisation, such as \cite{bayarkernel, candes2006robust, candes2007sparsity, candes2008introduction, kirolos2006analog, li2014gomp, polo2009compressive, pal2011coprime}, and methods which are not based on such optimisation, such as \cite{ariananda2011multicoset,ariananda2012compressive}.

Methods of the first group are based on the assumption that the signal contains few frequencies.%
\footnote{More specifically, methods of the first group are based on the assumption that the signal is sparse in a certain basis. Let $\vec{x}$ denote the signal sampled at the Nyquist-frequency. Also, let the matrix $\mat{\Phi}$ consist of rows of the identity matrix such that $\vec{y}=\mat{\Phi}\vec{x}$ represents the signal sampled at a sub-Nyquist frequency. If $\vec{x}$ is sparse in the basis $\mat{\Psi}$, then there exists a sparse vector $\vec{s}$ such that $\vec{x}=\mat{\Psi}\vec{s}$. Given $\vec{y}$, the original signal $\vec{x}$ can be obtained by finding the most sparse vector $\vec{\hat{s}}$ such that $\vec{y}=\mat{\Phi}\mat{\Psi}\vec{\hat{s}}$. Then $\vec{x} = \mat{\Psi}\vec{\hat{s}}$. This problem can be formulated as an $l_1$-optimisation problem. Since it is assumed that the signal contains few frequencies, $\mat{\Psi}$ is often chosen to be the discrete Fourier transform matrix.}
They then proceed to find a signal which contains few frequencies and matches the signal observed at sub-Nyquist frequencies. This can be done by optimisation or algorithms such as the MUSIC algorithm \cite{pal2011coprime}. There are a few problems with this approach. First, the assumption that the signal contains few frequencies may be not true in our case. (..) Second, solving an optimisition problem online or making use of an algorithm such as the MUSIC algorithm yields a computationally intensive method. This may be inadequate in our application, since (..). Based on these two reasons, we decide to discuss a reconstruction method similar to the method discussed in \cite{ariananda2012compressive}.
