\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter we have presented two different detection methods. We have observed that using our reconstruction method as described in \Cref{cha:reconstruction} affects the applicability of the default implementations of these detectors.  Furthermore we have noticed that the energy detection method for use with our reconstruction method is affected by the SNR wall. Although the CAV detection method does not suffer from this SNR wall due to its \emph{CFAR} property, it does introduce a new problem when it is required to detect in multiple frequency bands. Moreover the default threshold as derived in \cite{zheng2009spectrum} needs to be re-derived if CAV detection is to be used with our reconstruction method. Based on this analysis we therefore conclude that the modified energy detector is most suitable for use in combination with our reconstruction method: energy detection has relatively low-computational cost and can be used to detect in multiple frequency bands.  Using CAV detection needs additional analysis to support multiple frequency bands.
