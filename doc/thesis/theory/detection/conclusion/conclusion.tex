\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter we have presented two different detection methods. We have observed that using our reconstruction method as described in \Cref{cha:reconstruction} affects the threshold of the default implementations of these detectors. The threshold for CAV detection has therefore been re-derived in \cref{eq:threshold_cav_deriv} for use with our reconstruction method. Furthermore we have noticed that the energy detection method for use with our reconstruction method is affected by the SNR-wall. Although the CAV detection method does not suffer from this SNR wall due to its \emph{CFAR} property, it does introduce a new problem when filtering is to be used with the detector. Based on this analysis we therefore conclude that the modified energy detector is most suitable for use in combination with our reconstruction method: energy detection  has relatively low-computational cost and can be used to detect in multiple frequency bands.  Using CAV detection needs additional analysis to support multiple frequency bands, this however, remains future work.
