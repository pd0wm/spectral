\section{Results}

To test the three proposed detectors, we use a bandpass signal with bandwidth $-0.2\pi \leq \Omega \leq 0.2\pi$. This signal is constructed by applying a FIR filter with an impulse response of length $LN+1$ \footnote{To ensure limited correlation as is assumed in the reconstruction process} to circular complex Gaussian noise. The detection probability for both energy
detectors is evaluated in this band. The false alarm probability is evaluated in a band far enough way($0.6\pi \leq \Omega \leq 0.8\pi$) (to prevent detection in the passband of the filter).

The false alarm probability of CAV is evaluated in a separate run where there is no signal.
