\section{Overview}

The fundamental problem of detection is to discern noise from a signal. This problem can be formulated as a binary hypothesis test. Given a signal $x[n]$ a detector has to decide between the following two hypotheses:

\begin{align*}
	\begin{cases}
		\mathcal{H}_0 & x[n] = w[n] \\
		\mathcal{H}_1 & x[n] = w[n] + s[n]
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}

where $w[n]$ denotes a noise signal and $s[n]$ a signal different from noise. Under $\mathcal{H}_0$ the signal $x[n]$ contains only noise. Under $\mathcal{H}_1$ another signal besides noise is present in $x[n]$. Besides this hypothesis test, the detector also has to deal with frequency bands: which frequency bands are occupied by some signal and which are unoccupied?

We can distinguish between two types of detection methods to provide an answer to this problem:
\begin{enumerate}
\item detection methods based on information of the type of signals to be detected, such called \emph{prior information}.
\item detection methods methods working without any prior knowledge of the signals to be detected.
\end{enumerate}

In this chapter we will focus on the latter type. First of all, using \emph{prior information} results in more complex algorithms and needs knowledge of the signal types to be implemented and analyzed. Furthermore using a detector that depends on \emph{prior information} limits the applicability as it can only be used in constrained situations. 

This chapter will be concered with the analysis of the following two detection methods:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Energy detection;
	\item Covariance Absolute Value detection (CAV).
\end{enumerate}

In the subsequent sections it is assumed that noise is represented  by zero-mean \emph{circular symmetric complex gaussian} white noise\footnote{TODO ref naar appendix}, which we will simply refer to as white noise.
