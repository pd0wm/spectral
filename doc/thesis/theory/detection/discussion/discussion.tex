\section{Discussion}
In this chapter we have presented two different detection methods. We have seen that using our reconstruction method modifies the 
distribution of the estimate of the autocorrelation. Therefore thresholds of CAV and the conventional energy detector need to be re-derived
to yield the correct results. Furthermore we observe that performance of CAV on our testing signal is better than the performance of both energy 
detectors (even with perfect knowledge of the noise variance). However, to use CAV for detection in several frequency bands, the need of filters arise.

\todo{adapting CAV is future work. For now we have a working energy detector based on arianda's paper}
