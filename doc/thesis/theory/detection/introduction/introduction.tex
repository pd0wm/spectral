\section{Introduction}
In the previous chapters we have discussed how an estimate of the autocorrelation, or equivalently the power spectral density, of the input signal can be constructed. This estimate will serve
as input for the detector.

This chapter introduces several methods to perform the detection process as described in \cref{sec:theory-system-overview}. It is worthwhile to note that unlike conventional detectors, our detector has no access to the original received signal $x[n]$. Furthermore note that the estimate of the autocorrelation, $r_x[m]$, is the autocorrelation of a \emph{wide-band} signal. It therefore possibly conveys information of multiple frequency bands. As the detector has to distinguish between noise and signal on a frequency basis (\cref{sec:theory-specs}), this affects the detection methods that can be used in our system.  

We will start this chapter with a global overview of detection methods available. Based on this overview we will motivate the analysis of two detection methods, which are described later on. This analysis will lead to a conclusion of this chapter. For the technical reader a more in depth analysis is included in \cref{app:detector}.
