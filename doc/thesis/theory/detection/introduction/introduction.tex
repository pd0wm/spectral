\section{Introduction}
This chapter introduces several methods to perform the detection process on the output of the algorithm as described in \cref{sec:reconstruction-algorithm} instead of on the input signal itself. This algorithm produces an estimate of the power spectral density, or equivalently the autocorrelation of the input signal. The influence of using the output of this reconstruction method will be taken into account to produce a pragmatic description of several detection algorithms.  More in depth analysis will be included in \cref{app:detector}.

We will start this chapter with a global overview of detection methods available. Based on this overview we will motivate the analysis of two detection methods, which are described later on. This analysis will lead to a conclusion of this chapter.
