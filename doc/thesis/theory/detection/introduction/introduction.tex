\section{Introduction}
The fundamental problem of detection is to discern noise from a signal. This problem can be formulated as a binary hypothesis test. Given a signal $x[n]$ a detector has to decide between the following two hypotheses:

\begin{align*}
	\begin{cases}
		\mathcal{H}_0 & x[n] = w[n] \\
		\mathcal{H}_1 & x[n] = w[n] + s[n]
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}

where $w[n]$ denotes a noise signal and $s[n]$ a signal different from noise. Under $\mathcal{H}_0$ the signal $x[n]$ contains only noise. Under $\mathcal{H}_1$ another signal besides noise is present in $x[n]$.

Besides this hypothesis test, the detector also has to deal with frequency bands: which frequency bands are occupied by some signal and which are unoccupied?

This chapter examines two types of detectors that can be used in combination with our reconstructor:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Energy detection;	  
	\item Covariance absolute value detection (CAV).
\end{enumerate}
