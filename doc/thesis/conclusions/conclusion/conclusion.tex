\chapter{Conclusion}
After approximately two months, we can put our minds to rest and conclude our final work. Despite the division of this work into two parts, we consider it important to reflect upon those parts in one conclusion, since together, they form our final product. 

We have developed a theoretical framework whose specification are mostly met. Its performance has been evaluated and we can conclude that the framework provides the theoretical necessities to enable real-time spectrum sensing. Subsequently, we have developed a modular software toolkit which implements the developed theoretical framework. Together their performance has carefully been assessed. Courageously, we dare to say we have made a good attempt at answering the question whether we can develop a toolkit that enables real-time high-performance wideband spectrum sensing.

This thesis has been the desired opportunity demonstrate the knowledge we have accumulated the past three years. Although it may be a small step forward in the area of wideband spectrum sensing, we hope that we have encouraged the reader to follow the path we set out.
