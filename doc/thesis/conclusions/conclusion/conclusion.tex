\chapter{Conclusion}
% Eind conclusie

% wat wilden we ? Een high performance toolkit 
% wat hebben we gezien?

Approximately two months went by, and this is wat is left: the conclusion of our final work. Despite the division of this work into two parts, we consider it of importance to reflect upon those parts combined, as this is our final product. 

The problem statement has been introduced \cref{cha:problem_statement} which motivated the seperation into two parts. \cref{sec:theory-specs,sec:implementation-specs} have specified what this problem statement entails for both parts. Based on their respective discussions in \cref{cha:discussion_theory} we conclude that

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A theoretical framework succesfully has been set up that meet to \emph{must-haves} of the specifications;
	\item A modular implementation has succesfully implemented those algorithms
	\item TODO
\end{enumerate}
