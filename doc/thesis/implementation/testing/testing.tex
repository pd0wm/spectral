\section{Testing}
\subsection{Unit Tests}
With unit testing you can verify the code on the function level. With the help of special tools you can specify the expectations about the working of a function, in our case the Python \lib{unittest} library. Your functions are then run with predefined inputs and the behaviour of the code is then analysed and checked against your specifications.

Unit testing is a great way to easily test if your code follows your specifications, and does not break with certain edge cases. Because unit tests run fast, you can check your code often.

For the verification we also used \lib{coverage}. This extension on our unit testing library also keeps track of which lines of code are run during your tests. If certain lines of code are never ran, you know your tests are incomplete. An example of this can be found in \cref{fig:coverage_branch}. In this output a certain branch of an if statement is never taken.

Sometimes it is very easy to write specifications for the correct output of a function. However with certain functions in the reconstructor or the detector, the only way to verify the results was to check them according to known output matrix. These matrices were generated by a Matlab script that we assumed was correct.

\subsection{Integration tests}
Integration tests verify the working of the complete system, or a few modules working together.

\section{Qualities of good code}
We will discuss the quality of our code according to the definitions from Code Complete 2 about external and internal characteristics of quality code. External qualities are qualities the user of the software will notice. Internal qualities are only noticed by the developers of the software.\cite{mcconnell2004code}

\subsection{External qualities}
``\textit{Correctness} is the degree to which a system is free from faults in its specification, design, and implementation.'' For our design we used extensive testing to verify the correctness of our code and its results. Our algorithms are base on peer reviewed articles from established authors.

``\textit{Usability} is the ease with which users can learn and use a system.'' To easy the adaptability of our system we provide an extensive API documentation of every function of our code. This makes it easy to use the existing functions to expand the system to your own needs.

``\textit{Efficiency} is the minimal use of system resources, including memory and execution time.'' Our design is built with the idea of high performance. While writing the code we thoroughly optimised our program by making use of profiling. We identified bottlenecks and removed them if possible.

``\textit{Reliability} is the ability of a system to perform its required functions under state conditions whenever required --- having a long mean time between failures.'' Unit testing provides us with more certainty that our code is correct and will not fail in the case of an unlikely edge case.

``\textit{Integrity} is the degree to which a system prevents unauthorised or improper access to its programs and data. The idea of integrity includes restricting unauthorised user accesses as well ensuring that data is accessed properly --- that is, that tables with parallel data are modified in parallel, that date fields contain only valid dated, and so on.'' When transferring data between different processes we use thread-safe queues, or remote objects. This ensures that no race conditions or other issues with parallel data access can happen. We did not focus on preventing unauthorised access of our data when building this system, this is something that has to be considered when someone else then the user has access to the system.

``\textit{Adaptability} is the extent to which a system can be used, without modification, in applications or environments other than those for which it was specifically designed.'' Because we have written our system in python our code is runnable on all hardware that is supported by python. This includes all personal computers and even embedded devices with a decent ARM or MIPS processor.

``\textit{Accuracy} is the degree to which a system, as built, is free from error, especially with respect to quantitative outputs. Accuracy differs from correctness; it is a determination of how well a system does the job it's built for rather than whether it was built correctly.'' ** Programma van eisen ***

``\textit{Robustness} is the degree to which a system continues to function in the presence of invalid inputs or stressful environmental conditions.''

\subsection{Internal qualities}
``\textit{Maintainability} is the ease with which you modify a software system to change or add capabilities, improve performance, or correct defect.''

``\textit{Flexibility} is the extent to which you can modify a system for uses or environments other than those for which it was specifically designed.''

``\textit{Portability} is the ease with which you can modify a system to operate in an environment different from that for which it was specifically designed.''

``\textit{Reusability} is the extent to which you and the ease with which you can use parts of a system in other systems.''

``\textit{Readability} is the ease with which you can read and understand the source code of a system, especially at the detailed-statement level.''

``\textit{Testability} is the degree to which you can unit-test and system-test a system; the degree to which you can verify that the system meets its requirements.''

``\textit{Understandability} is the ease with which you can comprehend a system at both the system-organisational and detailed-statement levels. Understandability has to do with the coherence of the system at a more general level than readability does.''
