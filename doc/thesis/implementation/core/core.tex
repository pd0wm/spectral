\chapter{Functional Core}
In this chapter we will discuss the functional core of our system. We will describe each step of the process from sampling to detection. For each step we will describe which methods we used and what choices we made.

\section{Source}
\label{sec:source}
All our sources are derived from one base source, that defines the methods that every source should implement: the constructor and a \func{generate} function. This generate function should return the requsted number of samples using a specific sampling method. The rest of our source can be divided in two categories, the theoretical source used for testing our algorithms and real-world sources.

\subsection{Theoretical Source}
\label{sec:theoretical-source}
The theoretical source are used for testing our algorithms. They generate samples on the fly, or use pre-recorded data. These samples are then sampled according to a specific sampling method.
