\chapter{Future Work}
There are a number of options depending on which setting the product is going to be used.

\subsection{Distributed}
\label{sec:distributed}
A large part of the processes are ran in parallel. This allows for the system to be ran distributed amongst a number of machines. Alternatively a distributed network of reconstructors can be ran and the results from all these machines can be combined as done in collabarative sensing.

\subsection{Mobile platform}
