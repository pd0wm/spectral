\chapter{System Overview}
In this chapter we will give an overview of the chosen system architecture. In the following chapters we will describe each part of the system in more detail.

\section{Model-View-Presenter}
\label{sec:model-view-presenter}
The design of our system can best be described by a model-view-presenter (MVP) architectural pattern. It is a variation on the well known model-view-controller pattern. The components consist of the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Model] This encompasses the library \lib{cogradio}, that holds all the functional parts of our library. This means it contains the theoretical sources, the samplers, the reconstructors and the detectors.
    \item[Presenter] This encompasses part of the library \lib{cogradio\_vis}, that contains the Settings remote object and websockets. It functions as a driver for the model, taking the input from the view.
    \item[View] This encompasses part of the library \lib{cogradio\_vis}, that contains the GUI elements.
\end{description}
An overview can be seen in \cref{fig:MVP}.

\subsection{Model}
\label{sub:model}
The goal was to implement enough primitives in these libraries that a large number of configurations can quickly be constructed together. This is to account for the variety of configurations in which this product can be used. It also allows us to test different kind of sampling techniques with reconstruction methods.

A side effect of writing code this way is that it makes our code modular. This means most ``blocks'' can be tested individually. To accommodate this, the Strategy design pattern\footnote{The strategy pattern implements a family of algorithms behind an interface. It was first introduced in \cite{designpatterns}.} is used for all the models. This is further discussed in \cref{cha:model}.

\subsection{View}
\label{sub:view}
The view should supply the user with a clear overview of what is happening in the model and allow them to change execution parameters during runtime. It fulfils the role of a \emph{graphical user interface} or GUI. An additional requirement is that the view should be accessible to multiple users at the same time. How this is achieved will be described in \cref{cha:view}.

\subsection{Presenter}
\label{sub:presenter}
Finally, the presenter assumes the role of middle-man, in the sense that it forms the `glue' between model and view. It coordinates both their actions and allows them to interact in a controlled manner. A major feature of the presenter is that it coordinates the entire system in a concurrent manner, in stead of sequentially, which should greatly increase performance, since most tasks can be handled simultaneously. The presenter will be described in-depth in \cref{cha:presenter}.
