\section{USRP N210}
\label{sec:usrp-n210}

\subsection{Introduction}
The hardware sampler used in our system is a USRP N210, a software defined radio (SDR) produced by \textit{Ettus Research}. This radio is equipped with the SBX front-end, which has frequency range of \SIrange{400}{4400}{\mega\hertz} that can both transmit and receive simultaneously. This signal that enters the radio is first amplified and then mixed down by a two local oscillators with a \SI{90}{\degree} phase shift. Then the resulting two signals are sampled by two \SI{100}{\mega\sample\per\second} ADCs resulting in an I and a Q signal. Because the local oscillators have a \SI{90}{\degree} phase shift the resulting signal is quadrature or IQ sampled. With the information from both signals we can measure the complex envelope of the signal.

The USRPs can also be used as a transmitter using the DAC and the same local oscillators. We used this during the testing of our design to generate test signals. However this is not used in our final design.

These radios are connected to a PC by using gigabit Ethernet, thus limiting the effective sample rate to \SI{25}{\mega\sample\per\second} with a 16 bit resolution or \SI{50}{\mega\sample\per\second} with an 8 bit resolution. If you want to use the full potential of the internal ADC (2x \SI{100}{\mega\sample\per\second}) and DAC (2x \SI{400}{\mega\sample\per\second}) you have to write your own firmware for the internal FPGA.

\subsection{Drivers}
\label{sec:drivers}
The communication between the USRPs and our software is handled by the UHD driver\footnote{The code for this driver can be found online at: \url{https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd}.} written by \textit{Ettus Research}.

In the first version of our software we built everything using \lib{GNU Radio}. We used the \lib{gnuradio-uhd} blocks to get samples from our USRPs. Soon we switched to a pure Python version, but we still used the \lib{gnuradio-uhd} library to retrieve our samples. We used a specific helper function \func{gnuradio.uhd.finite\_acquisition} from the GNU Radio libraries. This helper function started a low level stream, waits for n samples, closes the stream and returns the samples to the caller.

The USRPs have an automatic calibration for the DC offset introduced by the local oscillator after the mixer. However due to a bug in the USRPs, every time a stream is started this DC calibration is reset. The effects of this bug can be resolved by limiting the bandwidth and shifting the local oscillator frequency out of the observed spectrum. This effectively halves our usable bandwidth.

To work around this bug we had to write our own low level code to stream samples from the device. We wrote \CC~code to connect to the USRPs, synchronise them and start a stream. The received samples are then send through a socket to the rest of the system for further processing. This was not an easy task, but has the added benefit that our system no longer depends on \lib{GNU Radio} and we have very low level control over the precise operation of the USRPs.
