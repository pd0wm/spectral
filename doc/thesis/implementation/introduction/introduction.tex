\chapter{Introduction}
\cref{prt:theory} provides an in-depth description of the theory required in the design of a high-performance sensing system.
In this part, we will describe how this theory was implemented into a system that integrates sampling, reconstruction and detection and presents the results in a web-application to any user that connects.
