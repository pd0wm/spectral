\section{Multiband Sensing}
\references{\cite{hossain2011wideband}\cite{quan2009optimal}}
Divide the to be scanned wideband channel into subchannels. Scan each of these subchannels seperately. Problems arise due to the fact that in practice the subchannels are not independant. Primary users occupancy and noise parameters can be correlated. The detection problem becomes a composite hypothesis problem\footnote{Multiple bands have to be evaluated to determine which hypotheses hold up. This greatly increases complexity.}

An extension to this is joint multiband sensing. Multiple cooperating sensors are used to improve the detection performance. Possibly leads to nonconvex and potentially NP-hard problems.
