\section{Context}
With the spectrum being a scarce resource nowadays, we need wireless technologies that cope with this problem. The CR\footnote{Cognitive Radio} paradigm encompasses dynamic spectrum allocation: every CR gains access to the available spectrum without causing harmful intereference to other licensed users. In order to
detect licensed users, one can apply compressive sensing. This technique allows to estimate the PSD\footnote{Power Spectral Density} using a sampling rate smaller than that prescribed by the Nyquist Sampling Theorem.
