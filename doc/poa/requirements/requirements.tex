\chapter{Requirements}
% Requirements:
% - Functional requirements:
% - Non-functional requirements
%   * Efficiency requirements: performance, space
%   * Reliability requirements
%   * Portability requirements
%   * Usability requirements
In this chapter we specify the functional and non-functional product requirements.
\section{Functional Requirements}
The functional product requirements are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item State-of-the-art techniques should be used to spectrum sense below Nyquist frequencies.
    \item The design should minimise primary user interfere while maintaining throughput.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
The non-functional product requirements are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The design should be as cheap as possible.
\end{enumerate}
